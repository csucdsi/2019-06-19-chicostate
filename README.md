# Data Carpentry - Skills to harness the power of data.


The [Chico State Data Science Initiative (DSI)](http://datascience.csuchico.edu) will be offering a 2-day [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) workshop this June 19 & 20th. This workshop is aimed at researchers and analysts at the [Center for Healthy Communities (CHC)](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/), but is also open to other campus researchers, graduate students and the public. 

This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including organizing data in spreadsheets, data management and visualization using R, and creating reproducible reports with markdown. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own data questions. You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop. Applications and examples using data from the Center for Healthy Communities will be presented.
